## ‚ùì What is cli_translater?
The name is self-described , an command line where your text is translated to another language in a fast-n-easy form.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works?
You send a source text to an intermediate Api translater which make all the proccess and send back the text translated. (API used on final of this file)
```

```ruby
{
    request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(url)
    request["content-type"] = 'application/json'
    request["X-RapidAPI-Key"] = '0ee2368128mshfbe96f93a6b18a1p1c6b93jsn478a278ca5df'
    request["X-RapidAPI-Host"] = 'rapid-translate-multi-traduction.p.rapidapi.com'
    request.body = "{
        \"from\": \"#{source}\",
        \"to\": \"#{trans}\",
        \"e\": \"\",
        \"q\": [
            \"#{text}\"
        ]
    }"

    response = http.request(request)
    data = JSON.parse(response.body)
